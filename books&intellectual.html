                    <strong>ðŸ“– Summary: Key Books & Intellectual Contributions â€“ Dr. B.R. Ambedkar : </strong>
                    Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was not only a political leader and social reformer but also a profound
                    intellectual whose works continue to shape modern India. His writings cover economics, social
                    justice, caste discrimination, law, religion, and political theory, offering deep insights into
                    India's structural issues. Through his books, he laid the foundation for constitutional democracy,
                    social equality, and economic reform.

                    <strong>Annihilation of Caste (1936)</strong>
                    This book is one of Ambedkarâ€™s most revolutionary works, where he strongly criticizes the Hindu
                    caste system and calls for its complete abolition. He argues that social reform is essential before
                    political freedom and urges Dalits to fight against caste-based oppression.

                    <strong>The Problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Its Solution (1923)</strong>
                    A landmark work in monetary economics, this book analyzed India's financial problems under British
                    rule. Ambedkarâ€™s recommendations on currency management and central banking played a crucial role in
                    the establishment of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 1935.

                    <strong>The Untouchables: </strong>
                    Who Were They and Why They Became Untouchables? (1948)
                    In this book, Ambedkar explores the historical roots of untouchability in India. He argues that
                    untouchables were originally Buddhists who were socially ostracized due to their resistance against
                    Brahminical dominance.

                    <strong>ðŸ“– Intellectual Legacy</strong> ðŸ“– Intellectual Legacy
                    Apart from his books, Ambedkar contributed to constitutional law, labor policies, women's rights,
                    and economic planning. His writings continue to influence social movements, legal debates, and
                    policy-making in India. His intellectual contributions not only fought against oppression and
                    inequality but also laid the groundwork for a progressive, democratic India.
