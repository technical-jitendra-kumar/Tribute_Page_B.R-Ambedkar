                <p>
                    <strong>ðŸ“– Summary: Established RBI Guidelines â€“ Dr. B.R. Ambedkar : </strong>
                    Dr. B.R. Ambedkar played a crucial role in shaping India's financial and banking policies. His book,
                    "The Problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Its Solution" (1923), was a landmark study on Indian
                    currency and monetary policy. This work provided a detailed analysis of India's financial issues
                    under British rule and offered solutions for a stable and independent economic system. His
                    recommendations were later used as a foundation for the establishment of the Reserve Bank of India
                    (RBI) in 1935.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ambedkar advocated for a centralized banking system to regulate currency, control inflation, and
                    ensure financial stability. He emphasized the need for an independent monetary policy, a structured
                    banking framework, and credit facilities for weaker sections of society. His ideas were incorporated
                    into the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, which led to the formation of the RBI as India's central
                    bank.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond RBI guidelines, Ambedkar was deeply concerned with economic planning and financial inclusion.
                    He advocated for state-led industrialization, labor rights, and economic policies that would benefit
                    the poor and marginalized communities. His vision ensured that India had a strong financial
                    foundation post-independence, allowing for economic growth and monetary stability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, <strong>Dr. Ambedkarâ€™s contributions to Indiaâ€™s economic policies remain highly
                        relevant,</strong> as his ideas continue to shape discussions on monetary regulation, financial
                    inclusion, and equitable economic growth.
