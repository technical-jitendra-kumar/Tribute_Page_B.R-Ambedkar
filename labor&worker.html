                <h2>Labor Reforms & Worker Rights</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>ðŸ“– Summary: Labor Reforms & Worker Rights â€“ Dr. B.R. Ambedkar : </strong>
                    Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was a strong advocate for labor rights and social justice, working tirelessly to
                    improve the conditions of workers in India. As Indiaâ€™s first Labor Minister in the Viceroyâ€™s
                    Executive Council (1942-1946), he introduced several groundbreaking reforms to protect workers from
                    exploitation and ensure fair wages, decent working conditions, and social security.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of his most significant contributions was the reduction of working hours from 14 hours to 8
                    hours a day, a historic achievement for labor welfare in British India. He also introduced equal pay
                    for equal work, maternity benefits for women, and safeguards against workplace exploitation. His
                    efforts led to the formulation of key labor laws, including the Mines Safety Act, the Factories Act,
                    and the Employeesâ€™ State Insurance (ESI) Scheme, which provided medical and financial benefits to
                    workers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ambedkar played a vital role in shaping Indiaâ€™s social security system, advocating for policies like
                    pension schemes, provident funds, and compensation for industrial injuries. His emphasis on
                    organized labor and trade unions strengthened workers' rights and gave them a collective voice. He
                    was also instrumental in the establishment of the Employment Exchange Act, ensuring job
                    opportunities for the unemployed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognizing the struggles of agricultural laborers, he pushed for land reforms and abolition of the
                    zamindari system to improve rural livelihoods. His vision for labor welfare extended beyond lawsâ€”he
                    saw it as a means to achieve social and economic equality in India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Ambedkarâ€™s contributions to labor rights laid the foundation for modern labor laws and social
                    security systems in India. His reforms continue to benefit millions of workers, ensuring better
                    wages, safe working conditions, and economic security.
