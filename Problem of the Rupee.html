                <h2>The Problem of the Rupee</h2>
                <p><strong>ðŸ“– Summary: The Problem of the Rupee</strong>
                    The Problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Its Solution is an influential economic work by Dr. B.R.
                    Ambedkar, published in 1923. In this book, Ambedkar critically analyzes the history and evolution of
                    India's currency system, highlighting the economic challenges caused by British monetary policies.
                    He traces the root causes of Indiaâ€™s financial instability, particularly the effects of the Gold
                    Exchange Standard, and explains how it led to inflation, deflation, and economic hardships for
                    Indians.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ambedkar critiques the British colonial monetary policies, arguing that they primarily served
                    British economic interests rather than benefiting India. He explains how the adoption of the Gold
                    Standard in the late 19th century negatively impacted India's economy by creating price instability
                    and restricting economic growth. He strongly opposed the Hilton Young Commission's recommendation to
                    continue the Gold Exchange Standard and instead advocated for a managed currency system, which would
                    provide more economic stability and protect India's financial independence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His recommendations were later considered in shaping India's Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which was
                    established in 1935. The Problem of the Rupee is a landmark contribution to Indian economic thought,
                    showcasing Ambedkarâ€™s expertise in monetary economics and his vision for a self-reliant financial
                    system. His analysis remains relevant even today, as it provides deep insights into currency
                    management, inflation control, and economic policy-making.
