        <h2>Promoted Education & Women's Rights</h2>
        <p>Dr. Ambedkar’s advocacy for education and women's rights was rooted in his belief that both are essential to achieving social equality. As a scholar and educator, he understood the transformative power of education. He worked relentlessly to promote the education of Dalits, women, and other marginalized sections of society.</p>

        <h3>Promoting Education</h3>
        <p>Ambedkar was a strong advocate for the education of Dalits and the underprivileged sections of society. He argued that education is the means to eradicate caste-based discrimination and social inequality. Some of his significant contributions in promoting education include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Education for Dalits:</strong> Dr. Ambedkar was determined to provide access to education for the Dalit community, who were often denied basic education due to caste-based oppression. He believed that education would help Dalits rise above their social status.</li>
            <li><strong>Establishment of Institutions:</strong> He played a crucial role in establishing various educational institutions to provide quality education to the marginalized. For instance, he was involved in the founding of the People’s Education Society, which aimed at spreading education among the untouchables.</li>
            <li><strong>Higher Education:</strong> Ambedkar was a scholar with degrees from prestigious institutions like Columbia University and the London School of Economics. His academic accomplishments became a source of inspiration for many marginalized students.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Advocacy for Women's Rights</h3>
        <p>Dr. Ambedkar was also a pioneer in advocating for women’s rights, firmly believing that the empowerment of women was crucial for the progress of society. Some of his key efforts in advancing women's rights included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Women’s Right to Property:</strong> As a member of the drafting committee of the Indian Constitution, Dr. Ambedkar ensured that women had equal rights to property. He fought for the inclusion of laws protecting women’s rights to inheritance and property.</li>
            <li><strong>The Hindu Code Bill:</strong> Ambedkar was instrumental in drafting the Hindu Code Bill, which sought to reform laws relating to marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption. Although it faced opposition and was not passed in his lifetime, the bill laid the foundation for later reforms in Hindu personal laws.</li>
            <li><strong>Social Reform:</strong> Ambedkar believed in the social and economic independence of women. He worked to improve their status within the family and society by advocating for education and equal opportunities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legacy in Education and Women's Empowerment</h3>
        <p>Dr. Ambedkar’s legacy continues to inspire movements for women’s education and empowerment in India. He laid the groundwork for educational reforms and social justice for women, ensuring their rights to education, property, and equality under the law. His emphasis on education as a tool for social mobility has left an indelible mark on India’s progress toward an inclusive and equal society.</p>
