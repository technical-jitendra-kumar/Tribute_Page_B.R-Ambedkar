                <h2>The Buddha and His Dhamma</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>ðŸ“– Summary: The Buddha and His Dhamma - </strong>
                    The Buddha and His Dhamma is the final and most profound work of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, published
                    posthumously in 1957. It serves as both a biography of Gautama Buddha and an in-depth exploration of
                    his teachings, philosophy, and impact on society. Ambedkar wrote this book not only to present
                    Buddhaâ€™s life but also to reinterpret his teachings in a rational and modern context, free from
                    later distortions by religious traditions.

                <p>
                    The book is divided into multiple sections, detailing Buddhaâ€™s early life, enlightenment, and the
                    spread of his Dhamma (teachings). Ambedkar highlights how Buddhism offers an ethical and practical
                    way of life based on liberty, equality, and fraternity, principles that closely align with his
                    vision of a just society. He contrasts Buddhaâ€™s rational and compassionate philosophy with the rigid
                    and oppressive caste system of Hinduism, arguing that Buddhism provides a path to social
                    transformation and personal liberation.

                    Ambedkar also presents Buddhism as a solution to social inequality, particularly for the oppressed
                    and marginalized communities. The book served as the foundation for the Dalit Buddhist movement,
                    inspiring millions to convert to Buddhism as a rejection of caste oppression. The Buddha and His
                    Dhamma remains a crucial text for those interested in Buddhism, social justice, and Ambedkarâ€™s
                    intellectual legacy.
