                <h2>Annihilation of Caste</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>ðŸ“– Summary: Annihilation of Caste - </strong>
                    Annihilation of Caste is a powerful and radical work by <strong>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</strong>, originally written as a
                    speech in 1936. However, it was never delivered because the organizers found its content too
                    controversial. In this book, Ambedkar provides a sharp critique of the Hindu caste system and argues
                    that caste-based discrimination is deeply rooted in religious and social practices. He asserts that
                    true equality can never be achieved without completely dismantling the caste system, rather than
                    attempting to reform it from within.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ambedkar</strong> strongly criticizes Hindu religious texts, which he believes perpetuate caste-based
                    oppression. He calls for a complete rejection of the social hierarchy and urges lower-caste
                    individuals to assert their rights through education, political participation, and social
                    resistance. His views directly challenge Mahatma Gandhi, who believed that caste could be reformed
                    while maintaining Hindu traditions. Ambedkar, on the other hand, argues that caste is a moral and
                    social evil that must be destroyed entirely for true social justice to be achieved.

                <p>
                    In Annihilation of Caste, <strong>Ambedkar</strong>Ambedkar advocates for liberty, equality, and fraternity, emphasizing that
                    political independence is meaningless without social equality. His ideas remain highly relevant
                    today, inspiring movements for Dalit rights, social justice, and caste-based reforms in India and
                    beyond. This book is considered one of the most important works in the fight against caste
                    discrimination and remains a must-read for anyone interested in social justice and human rights.
