                <h2>Architect of the Indian Constitution â€“ Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</h2>
                <p><strong>ðŸ“– Summary: Architect of the Indian Constitution â€“ Dr. B.R. Ambedkar</strong>
                    Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, widely regarded as the Architect of the Indian Constitution, played a pivotal
                    role in shaping modern India. As the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, he was instrumental in
                    framing a Constitution that upheld justice, equality, liberty, and fraternity for all citizens,
                    particularly safeguarding the rights of marginalized communities. His deep understanding of law,
                    economics, and social justice helped create a framework that ensured fundamental rights, democracy,
                    and social reform in independent India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Born in 1891, Ambedkar faced severe caste-based discrimination but overcame challenges through
                    education and determination. He earned multiple degrees, including a doctorate in economics from
                    Columbia University and the London School of Economics. His lifelong mission was to uplift Dalits
                    (Untouchables) and other oppressed sections of society, advocating for reservations in education and
                    jobs, abolition of untouchability, and equal rights for women and laborers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from his contributions to the Constitution, Ambedkar was a strong advocate of economic
                    planning, labor rights, and social justice. His vision led to the establishment of key financial
                    institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In his later years, disillusioned with caste
                    oppression in Hinduism, he embraced Buddhism in 1956, leading a historic mass conversion movement.

                <p>
                    Dr. Ambedkarâ€™s legacy continues to inspire millions, and his efforts in nation-building, social
                    reform, and legal justice remain unparalleled. His Constitution remains the foundation of Indiaâ€™s
                    democracy, ensuring equal rights and dignity for every citizen.
